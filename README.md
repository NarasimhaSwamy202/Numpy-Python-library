Python is a widely used programming language in the field of data science, and it offers a rich ecosystem of libraries that facilitate various aspects of data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and machine learning. Here are some key Python libraries commonly used in data science:

1/ NumPy:
Purpose: Numerical computing.
Key Features: Multi-dimensional arrays, linear algebra operations, mathematical functions.
import numpy as np

2/ Pandas:
Purpose: Data manipulation and analysis.
Key Features: DataFrame for structured data, powerful data manipulation tools.
import pandas as pd

3/ Matplotlib:
Purpose: 2D plotting library.
Key Features: Line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, and more.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

4/ Seaborn:
Purpose: Statistical data visualization based on Matplotlib.
Key Features: Simplifies complex visualizations, integrates with Pandas.
import seaborn as sns

5/ SciPy:
Purpose: Scientific and technical computing.
Key Features: Integration, optimization, signal and image processing.
from scipy import optimize 

6/ Scikit-learn:
Purpose: Machine learning library.
Key Features: Classification, regression, clustering, model selection.
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

7/ TensorFlow and PyTorch:
Purpose: Deep learning libraries.
Key Features: Building and training neural networks.
import tensorflow as tf

8/ Statsmodels:
Purpose: Statistical modeling and hypothesis testing.
Key Features: Regression models, time-series analysis.
import statsmodels.api as sm
